I. Installation Steps for MPICH 

1. Download mpich from https://www.mpich.org/.
2. Extract the tar file.
        tar -xfz mpich.3.2.1.tar.gz
3. Goto extracted folder. 
        cd mpich-3.2.1
4. Create an installion directory 
        mkdir mpich_install
5. Configure the mpich
        ./configure --prefix=/mpich_install | tee .txt
Hurdle 1:        
        error:configure: error: No Fortran 77 compiler found. If you don't need to
                build any Fortran programs, you can disable Fortran support using
                --disable-fortran. If you do want to build Fortran
                programs, you need to install a Fortran compiler such as gfortran
                or ifort before you can proceed.
                
        Solved: 
        1. installed fortran compiler :sudo apt install gfortran

6. Build MPICH:
	make 2>&1 | tee m.txt   

7. install the MPICH commands
         make install |& tee mi.txt

8. Set the installed bin directory to PATH. Write below lines in .bashrc
        PATH=/home/you/mpich-install/bin:$PATH
        export PATH

9. Check the PATH is updated by running
        which mpicc
        -> It should return the installed path

II. Steps to enable the passwordless SSH

1. Generate a pair of public keys using following command.
        ssh-keygen -t rsa

2. Create .ssh directory 
        ssh swapnilr@172.27.19.22 mkdir -p .ssh

3. Upload Generated Public Keys to system
        cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh swapnilr@172.27.19.22 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

4. Set Permissions
        ssh swapnilr@172.27.19.22 "chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys"

5. Login to machine through ssh without password
