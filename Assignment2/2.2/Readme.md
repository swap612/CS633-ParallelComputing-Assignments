Assignment 2.2
====
## Implementing a ping-pong benchmark to measure the average bandwidth

## Steps to run the program    
On HPC2010  
    1. make   
    2. qsub run.sh -> it will generate the plotdata files required for plotting the graphs

## Observations from plots:    
1. Average BandWidth for N=4 is about 1750 MB/sand for N=16 it about 510MB/s and Maximum BW is 1860 MB/s and 520 MB/s for N=4 and 16 respectively.
2. This variation may be due to load and traffic on HPC network with big N
